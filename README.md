## [Web Demo](https://cupofme.github.io/force_directed_graphview/#/)

## Overview

A highly customizable library for displaying force-directed graphs in Flutter.

This library is primarily designed to display graphs using force-directed layouts, but it can be used for other purposes as well with the implementation of a custom layout algorithm. Currently nodes can't be dragged by gestures. The entire canvas can be dragged and zoomed using underlying [InteractiveViewer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InteractiveViewer-class.html) widget.

## Usage

For example usage see [Example](https://github.com/cupofme/force_directed_graphview/blob/main/example/lib/src/screens/general_demo_screen.dart)
